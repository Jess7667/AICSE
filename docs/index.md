## Knowledge Recognition Notebook(KRN)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jess7667/AICSE/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

A knowledge recognition notebook is designed to help scientists, engineers with their understanding of a topic or concept, typically taking the form of a comprehensive literature review using metadata from Microsoft Academic, Crossref and OpenCitations. book chapters, books, journal articles, conference publications, patents, government documents, which cite one another, thus creating a citation network (= graph). Each node (= vertex) represents an article/book/patent or document and each edge (= link / arrow) represents a reference / citation. Citation graphs are a topic of bibliometrics, for which other great software exists as well.

This application visualizes subsets of the global citation network, that defines the most important elements of a given topic or concept, defined by the references of a given set of input articles, book chapters, and books. In addition, the locally most cited references missing in the set of inputted items are suggested for further review.
